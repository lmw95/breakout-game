# Breakout!

![](assets/media/breakout.png)

This game was built using the [Mozilla 2D game guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript), implementing my own design to the game. This game allows you to keep track of your score and get 3 lives to complete the game.

**Features I want to add:**
* Settings to change ball speed
* Functionality so that when ball hits a brick, they crack rather than disappear straight away
* A user-friendly and on-theme popup to indicate when game is over or won
